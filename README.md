The original datasets from which I extracted all data used, including hurricane characteristics (ian.xlsx) and power outage (Ian.csv) and the social vulnerability data are in my google drive in this link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RkxZu23qWTWTRnUgQNJANqFvnhPQRsxE?usp=drive_link



HURRICANE IAN 

Among the 19 hurricanes that made landfall between 2017 and 2023, Hurricane Ian (2022) has been selected for the landfall in Florida USA.

The data we have contains up to 90 days of power outage after hurricane landfall. This is to monitor the recovery of the power overtime to see which county recover faster and why. The main aim is to find the correlation between the duration of power restoration and socioeconomic factors. 

Clusters analysis- Using K-means clustering and DBSCAN, this is to check correlation between duration of power outage duration/severity and socioeconomic factors and hurricane wind impact speed. 

Predicton of county social vulnerability index- Using multtiple regression, logistics model and neuran network model. 

The project sets out to provide a comprehensive analysis of the distribution of power outage effects across counties in Florida, with a focus on understanding the interplay between social vulnerability and the severity of hurricane impact. By examining these critical factors in tandem, the aim is to offer valuable insights that can inform decision-making processes for relevant agencies and stakeholders. Through this analysis, decision-makers will gain a clearer understanding of which areas are most in need of priority attention when it comes to power restoration efforts. This approach will enable the efficient allocation of resources and assistance to communities that are particularly vulnerable or have been disproportionately affected by the impact of hurricanes. Ultimately, the project seeks to enhance the resilience of communities in the face of power outages by providing evidence-based guidance on where to direct support and resources to mitigate the adverse effects of such events.
